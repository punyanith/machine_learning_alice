CHAPTER I.\uc0\u8232 Down the Rabbit-Hole\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \'93and what is the use of a book,\'94 thought Alice \'93without pictures or conversations?\'94\
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\
There was nothing so\'a0
\f1\i very
\f0\i0 \'a0remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so\'a0
\f1\i very
\f0\i0 \'a0much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \'93Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\'94 (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually\'a0
\f1\i took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket
\f0\i0 , and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.\
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \'93ORANGE MARMALADE\'94, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\
\'93Well!\'94 thought Alice to herself, \'93after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\'92ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\'92t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\'94 (Which was very likely true.)\
Down, down, down. Would the fall\'a0
\f1\i never
\f0\i0 \'a0come to an end? \'93I wonder how many miles I\'92ve fallen by this time?\'94 she said aloud. \'93I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think\'97\'94 (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a\'a0
\f1\i very
\f0\i0 \'a0good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \'93\'97yes, that\'92s about the right distance\'97but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\'92ve got to?\'94 (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\
Presently she began again. \'93I wonder if I shall fall right\'a0
\f1\i through
\f0\i0 \'a0the earth! How funny it\'92ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\'97\'94 (she was rather glad there\'a0
\f1\i was
\f0\i0 \'a0no one listening, this time, as it didn\'92t sound at all the right word) \'93\'97but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma\'92am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\'94 (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\'97fancy\'a0
\f1\i curtseying
\f0\i0 \'a0as you\'92re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \'93And what an ignorant little girl she\'92ll think me for asking! No, it\'92ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\'94\
Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. \'93Dinah\'92ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\'94 (Dinah was the cat.) \'93I hope they\'92ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I\'92m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\'92s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\'94 And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \'93Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\'94 and sometimes, \'93Do bats eat cats?\'94 for, you see, as she couldn\'92t answer either question, it didn\'92t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \'93Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\'94 when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \'93Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it\'92s getting!\'94 She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\'92s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; \'93and even if my head would go through,\'94 thought poor Alice, \'93it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\'94 For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.\
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (\'93which certainly was not here before,\'94 said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \'93DRINK ME,\'94 beautifully printed on it in large letters.\
It was all very well to say \'93Drink me,\'94 but the wise little Alice was not going to do\'a0
\f1\i that
\f0\i0 \'a0in a hurry. \'93No, I\'92ll look first,\'94 she said, \'93and see whether it\'92s marked \'91
\f1\i poison
\f0\i0 \'92 or not\'94; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\'a0
\f1\i would
\f0\i0 \'a0not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger\'a0
\f1\i very
\f0\i0 \'a0deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \'93poison,\'94 it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\
However, this bottle was\'a0
\f1\i not
\f0\i0 \'a0marked \'93poison,\'94 so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\

\AppleTypeServices \cf0 \'93What a curious feeling!\'94 said Alice; \'93I must be shutting up like a telescope.\'94\
And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \'93for it might end, you know,\'94 said Alice to herself, \'93in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?\'94 And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.\
After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\
\'93Come, there\'92s no use in crying like that!\'94 said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \'93I advise you to leave off this minute!\'94 She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. \'93But it\'92s no use now,\'94 thought poor Alice, \'93to pretend to be two people! Why, there\'92s hardly enough of me left to make\'a0
\f1\i one
\f0\i0 \'a0respectable person!\'94\
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \'93EAT ME\'94 were beautifully marked in currants. \'93Well, I\'92ll eat it,\'94 said Alice, \'93and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\'92ll get into the garden, and I don\'92t care which happens!\'94\
She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \'93Which way? Which way?\'94, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.\
So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\

\fs24 \cf0 \'93Curiouser and curiouser!\'94 cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \'93now I\'92m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\'94 (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). \'93Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\'92m sure\'a0
\f1\i I
\f0\i0 \'a0shan\'92t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;\'97but I must be kind to them,\'94 thought Alice, \'93or perhaps they won\'92t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I\'92ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.\'94\
And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \'93They must go by the carrier,\'94 she thought; \'93and how funny it\'92ll seem, sending presents to one\'92s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\

\f0\fs24 \cf0 Oh dear, what nonsense I\'92m talking!\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\
Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\
\'93You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\'94 said Alice, \'93a great girl like you,\'94 (she might well say this), \'93to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!\'94 But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\
After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \'93Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won\'92t she be savage if I\'92ve kept her waiting!\'94 Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \'93If you please, sir\'97\'94 The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\
Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \'93Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I\'92ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I\'92m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah,\'a0
\f1\i that\'92s
\f0\i0 \'a0the great puzzle!\'94 And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\
\'93I\'92m sure I\'92m not Ada,\'94 she said, \'93for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn\'92t go in ringlets at all; and I\'92m sure I can\'92t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides,\'a0
\f1\i she\'92s
\f0\i0 \'a0she, and\'a0
\f1\i I\'92m
\f0\i0 \'a0I, and\'97oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I\'92ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\'97oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn\'92t signify: let\'92s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome\'97no,\'a0
\f1\i that\'92s
\f0\i0 \'a0all wrong, I\'92m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I\'92ll try and say \'91
\f1\i How doth the little
\f0\i0 \'97\'92\'94 and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:\'97\
\pard\pardeftab720\li1405\fi-1405\sa288\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf0 \'93How doth the little crocodile\uc0\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0Improve his shining tail,\u8232 And pour the waters of the Nile\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0On every golden scale!\u8232 \u8232 \'93How cheerfully he seems to grin,\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0How neatly spread his claws,\u8232 And welcome little fishes in\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0With gently smiling jaws!\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 \'93I\'92m sure those are not the right words,\'94 said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, \'93I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\'92ve made up my mind about it; if I\'92m Mabel, I\'92ll stay down here! It\'92ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying \'91Come up again, dear!\'92 I shall only look up and say \'91Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I\'92ll come up: if not, I\'92ll stay down here till I\'92m somebody else\'92\'97but, oh dear!\'94 cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, \'93I do wish they\'a0
\f1\i would
\f0\i0 \'a0put their heads down! I am so\'a0
\f1\i very
\f0\i0 \'a0tired of being all alone here!\'94\
As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit\'92s little white kid gloves while she was talking. \'93How\'a0
\f1\i can
\f0\i0 \'a0I have done that?\'94 she thought. \'93I must be growing small again.\'94 She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\
\'93That\'a0
\f1\i was
\f0\i0 \'a0a narrow escape!\'94 said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \'93and now for the garden!\'94 and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, \'93and things are worse than ever,\'94 thought the poor child, \'93for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it\'92s too bad, that it is!\'94\
As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, \'93and in that case I can go back by railway,\'94 she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.\
\'93I wish I hadn\'92t cried so much!\'94 said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. \'93I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That\'a0
\f1\i will
\f0\i0 \'a0be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.\'94\
Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\
\'93Would it be of any use, now,\'94 thought Alice, \'93to speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there\'92s no harm in trying.\'94 So she began: \'93O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\'94 (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother\'92s Latin Grammar, \'93A mouse\'97of a mouse\'97to a mouse\'97a mouse\'97O mouse!\'94) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.\
\'93Perhaps it doesn\'92t understand English,\'94 thought Alice; \'93I daresay it\'92s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\'94 (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: \'93O\'f9 est ma chatte?\'94 which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \'93Oh, I beg your pardon!\'94 cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal\'92s feelings. \'93I quite forgot you didn\'92t like cats.\'94\
\'93Not like cats!\'94 cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \'93Would\'a0
\f1\i you
\f0\i0 \'a0like cats if you were me?\'94\
\'93Well, perhaps not,\'94 said Alice in a soothing tone: \'93don\'92t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\'92d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,\'94 Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, \'93and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face\'97and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse\'97and she\'92s such a capital one for catching mice\'97oh, I beg your pardon!\'94 cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \'93We won\'92t talk about her any more if you\'92d rather not.\'94\
\'93We indeed!\'94 cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. \'93As if\'a0
\f1\i I
\f0\i0 \'a0would talk on such a subject! Our family always\'a0
\f1\i hated
\f0\i0 \'a0cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\'92t let me hear the name again!\'94\
\'93I won\'92t indeed!\'94 said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. \'93Are you\'97are you fond\'97of\'97of dogs?\'94 The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: \'93There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\'92ll fetch things when you throw them, and it\'92ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things\'97I can\'92t remember half of them\'97and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it\'92s so useful, it\'92s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and\'97oh dear!\'94 cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, \'93I\'92m afraid I\'92ve offended it again!\'94 For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\
So she called softly after it, \'93Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won\'92t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\'92t like them!\'94 When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, \'93Let us get to the shore, and then I\'92ll tell you my history, and you\'92ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\'94\
It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\

\fs56 \cf0 CHAPTER III.\uc0\u8232 A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank\'97the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\
The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \'93I am older than you, and must know better;\'94 and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.\
At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, \'93Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!\'a0
\f1\i I\'92ll
\f0\i0 \'a0soon make you dry enough!\'94 They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\
\'93Ahem!\'94 said the Mouse with an important air, \'93are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \'91William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria\'97\'92\'94\
\'93Ugh!\'94 said the Lory, with a shiver.\
\'93I beg your pardon!\'94 said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \'93Did you speak?\'94\
\'93Not I!\'94 said the Lory hastily.\
\'93I thought you did,\'94 said the Mouse. \'93\'97I proceed. \'91Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable\'97\'92\'94\
\'93Found\'a0
\f1\i what
\f0\i0 ?\'94 said the Duck.\
\'93Found\'a0
\f1\i it
\f0\i0 ,\'94 the Mouse replied rather crossly: \'93of course you know what \'91it\'92 means.\'94\
\'93I know what \'91it\'92 means well enough, when\'a0
\f1\i I
\f0\i0 \'a0find a thing,\'94 said the Duck: \'93it\'92s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?\'94\
The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \'93\'91\'97found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William\'92s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans\'97\'92 How are you getting on now, my dear?\'94 it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.\
\'93As wet as ever,\'94 said Alice in a melancholy tone: \'93it doesn\'92t seem to dry me at all.\'94\
\'93In that case,\'94 said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \'93I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies\'97\'94\
\'93Speak English!\'94 said the Eaglet. \'93I don\'92t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what\'92s more, I don\'92t believe you do either!\'94 And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.\
\'93What I was going to say,\'94 said the Dodo in an offended tone, \'93was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\'94\
\'93What\'a0
\f1\i is
\f0\i0 \'a0a Caucus-race?\'94 said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that\'a0
\f1\i somebody
\f0\i0 \'a0ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\
\'93Why,\'94 said the Dodo, \'93the best way to explain it is to do it.\'94 (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\
First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (\'93the exact shape doesn\'92t matter,\'94 it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no \'93One, two, three, and away,\'94 but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out \'93The race is over!\'94 and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, \'93But who has won?\'94\
This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, \'93
\f1\i Everybody
\f0\i0 \'a0has won, and all must have prizes.\'94\
\'93But who is to give the prizes?\'94 quite a chorus of voices asked.\
\'93Why,\'a0
\f1\i she
\f0\i0 , of course,\'94 said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, \'93Prizes! Prizes!\'94\
Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all round.\
\'93But she must have a prize herself, you know,\'94 said the Mouse.\
\'93Of course,\'94 the Dodo replied very gravely. \'93What else have you got in your pocket?\'94 he went on, turning to Alice.\
\'93Only a thimble,\'94 said Alice sadly.\
\'93Hand it over here,\'94 said the Dodo.\
Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying \'93We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;\'94 and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.\
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.\
The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\
\'93You promised to tell me your history, you know,\'94 said Alice, \'93and why it is you hate\'97C and D,\'94 she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.\
\'93Mine is a long and a sad tale!\'94 said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.\
\'93It\'a0
\f1\i is
\f0\i0 \'a0a long tail, certainly,\'94 said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse\'92s tail; \'93but why do you call it sad?\'94 And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:\'97\

\f0\fs24 \cf0 \'93You are not attending!\'94 said the Mouse to Alice severely. \'93What are you thinking of?\'94\
\'93I beg your pardon,\'94 said Alice very humbly: \'93you had got to the fifth bend, I think?\'94\
\'93I had\'a0
\f1\i not!
\f0\i0 \'94 cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\
\'93A knot!\'94 said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. \'93Oh, do let me help to undo it!\'94\
\'93I shall do nothing of the sort,\'94 said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \'93You insult me by talking such nonsense!\'94\
\'93I didn\'92t mean it!\'94 pleaded poor Alice. \'93But you\'92re so easily offended, you know!\'94\
The Mouse only growled in reply.\
\'93Please come back and finish your story!\'94 Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, \'93Yes, please do!\'94 but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\
\'93What a pity it wouldn\'92t stay!\'94 sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter \'93Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\'a0
\f1\i your
\f0\i0 \'a0temper!\'94 \'93Hold your tongue, Ma!\'94 said the young Crab, a little snappishly. \'93You\'92re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\'94\
\'93I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\'94 said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. \'93She\'92d soon fetch it back!\'94\
\'93And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\'94 said the Lory.\
Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: \'93Dinah\'92s our cat. And she\'92s such a capital one for catching mice you can\'92t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she\'92ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\'94\
This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, \'93I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn\'92t suit my throat!\'94 and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, \'93Come away, my dears! It\'92s high time you were all in bed!\'94 On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.\
\'93I wish I hadn\'92t mentioned Dinah!\'94 she said to herself in a melancholy tone. \'93Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I\'92m sure she\'92s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!\'94 And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.\

\fs56 \cf0 CHAPTER IV.\uc0\u8232 The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself \'93The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She\'92ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where\'a0
\f1\i can
\f0\i0 \'a0I have dropped them, I wonder?\'94 Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen\'97everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.\
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, \'93Why, Mary Ann, what\'a0
\f1\i are
\f0\i0 \'a0you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\'94 And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.\
\'93He took me for his housemaid,\'94 she said to herself as she ran. \'93How surprised he\'92ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\'92d better take him his fan and gloves\'97that is, if I can find them.\'94 As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \'93W. RABBIT,\'94 engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.\
\'93How queer it seems,\'94 Alice said to herself, \'93to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah\'92ll be sending me on messages next!\'94 And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \'93\'91Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!\'92 \'91Coming in a minute, nurse! But I\'92ve got to see that the mouse doesn\'92t get out.\'92 Only I don\'92t think,\'94 Alice went on, \'93that they\'92d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!\'94\
By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words \'93DRINK ME,\'94 but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. \'93I know\'a0
\f1\i something
\f0\i0 \'a0interesting is sure to happen,\'94 she said to herself, \'93whenever I eat or drink anything; so I\'92ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it\'92ll make me grow large again, for really I\'92m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\'94\
It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself \'93That\'92s quite enough\'97I hope I shan\'92t grow any more\'97As it is, I can\'92t get out at the door\'97I do wish I hadn\'92t drunk quite so much!\'94\
Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \'93Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What\'a0
\f1\i will
\f0\i0 \'a0become of me?\'94\
Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\
\'93It was much pleasanter at home,\'94 thought poor Alice, \'93when one wasn\'92t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn\'92t gone down that rabbit-hole\'97and yet\'97and yet\'97it\'92s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\'a0
\f1\i can
\f0\i0 \'a0have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I\'92ll write one\'97but I\'92m grown up now,\'94 she added in a sorrowful tone; \'93at least there\'92s no room to grow up any more\'a0
\f1\i here
\f0\i0 .\'94\
\'93But then,\'94 thought Alice, \'93shall I\'a0
\f1\i never
\f0\i0 \'a0get any older than I am now? That\'92ll be a comfort, one way\'97never to be an old woman\'97but then\'97always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn\'92t like\'a0
\f1\i that!
\f0\i0 \'94\
\'93Oh, you foolish Alice!\'94 she answered herself. \'93How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there\'92s hardly room for\'a0
\f1\i you
\f0\i0 , and no room at all for any lesson-books!\'94\
And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\
\'93Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\'94 said the voice. \'93Fetch me my gloves this moment!\'94 Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\
Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice\'92s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself \'93Then I\'92ll go round and get in at the window.\'94\
\'93
\f1\i That
\f0\i0 \'a0you won\'92t!\'94 thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\
Next came an angry voice\'97the Rabbit\'92s\'97\'93Pat! Pat! Where are you?\'94 And then a voice she had never heard before, \'93Sure then I\'92m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!\'94\
\'93Digging for apples, indeed!\'94 said the Rabbit angrily. \'93Here! Come and help me out of\'a0
\f1\i this!
\f0\i0 \'94 (Sounds of more broken glass.)\
\'93Now tell me, Pat, what\'92s that in the window?\'94\
\'93Sure, it\'92s an arm, yer honour!\'94 (He pronounced it \'93arrum.\'94)\
\'93An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!\'94\
\'93Sure, it does, yer honour: but it\'92s an arm for all that.\'94\
\'93Well, it\'92s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\'94\
There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, \'93Sure, I don\'92t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!\'94 \'93Do as I tell you, you coward!\'94 and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\'a0
\f1\i two
\f0\i0 \'a0little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \'93What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!\'94 thought Alice. \'93I wonder what they\'92ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\'a0
\f1\i could!
\f0\i0 \'a0I\'92m sure\'a0
\f1\i I
\f0\i0 \'a0don\'92t want to stay in here any longer!\'94\
She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: \'93Where\'92s the other ladder?\'97Why, I hadn\'92t to bring but one; Bill\'92s got the other\'97Bill! fetch it here, lad!\'97Here, put \'92em up at this corner\'97No, tie \'92em together first\'97they don\'92t reach half high enough yet\'97Oh! they\'92ll do well enough; don\'92t be particular\'97Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope\'97Will the roof bear?\'97Mind that loose slate\'97Oh, it\'92s coming down! Heads below!\'94 (a loud crash)\'97\'93Now, who did that?\'97It was Bill, I fancy\'97Who\'92s to go down the chimney?\'97Nay,\'a0
\f1\i I
\f0\i0 \'a0shan\'92t!\'a0
\f1\i You
\f0\i0 \'a0do it!\'97
\f1\i That
\f0\i0 \'a0I won\'92t, then!\'97Bill\'92s to go down\'97Here, Bill! the master says you\'92re to go down the chimney!\'94\
\'93Oh! So Bill\'92s got to come down the chimney, has he?\'94 said Alice to herself. \'93Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn\'92t be in Bill\'92s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I\'a0
\f1\i think
\f0\i0 \'a0I can kick a little!\'94\
She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn\'92t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself \'93This is Bill,\'94 she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.\
The first thing she heard was a general chorus of \'93There goes Bill!\'94 then the Rabbit\'92s voice along\'97\'93Catch him, you by the hedge!\'94 then silence, and then another confusion of voices\'97\'93Hold up his head\'97Brandy now\'97Don\'92t choke him\'97How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!\'94\
Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (\'93That\'92s Bill,\'94 thought Alice,) \'93Well, I hardly know\'97No more, thank ye; I\'92m better now\'97but I\'92m a deal too flustered to tell you\'97all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\'94\
\'93So you did, old fellow!\'94 said the others.\
\'93We must burn the house down!\'94 said the Rabbit\'92s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, \'93If you do, I\'92ll set Dinah at you!\'94\
There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \'93I wonder what they\'a0
\f1\i will
\f0\i0 \'a0do next! If they had any sense, they\'92d take the roof off.\'94 After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \'93A barrowful will do, to begin with.\'94\
\'93A barrowful of\'a0
\f1\i what?
\f0\i0 \'94 thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. \'93I\'92ll put a stop to this,\'94 she said to herself, and shouted out, \'93You\'92d better not do that again!\'94 which produced another dead silence.\
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. \'93If I eat one of these cakes,\'94 she thought, \'93it\'92s sure to make\'a0
\f1\i some
\f0\i0 \'a0change in my size; and as it can\'92t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.\'94\
So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.\
\'93The first thing I\'92ve got to do,\'94 said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \'93is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.\'94\
It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.\
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \'93Poor little thing!\'94 said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\
Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy\'92s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\
\'93And yet what a dear little puppy it was!\'94 said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: \'93I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if\'97if I\'92d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I\'92d nearly forgotten that I\'92ve got to grow up again! Let me see\'97how\'a0
\f1\i is
\f0\i0 \'a0it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?\'94\
The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.\
She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.\

\fs56 \cf0 CHAPTER V.\uc0\u8232 Advice from a Caterpillar\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\
\'93Who are\'a0
\f1\i you?
\f0\i0 \'94 said the Caterpillar.\
This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, \'93I\'97I hardly know, sir, just at present\'97at least I know who I\'a0
\f1\i was
\f0\i0 \'a0when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.\'94\
\'93What do you mean by that?\'94 said the Caterpillar sternly. \'93Explain yourself!\'94\
\'93I can\'92t explain\'a0
\f1\i myself
\f0\i0 , I\'92m afraid, sir,\'94 said Alice, \'93because I\'92m not myself, you see.\'94\
\'93I don\'92t see,\'94 said the Caterpillar.\
\'93I\'92m afraid I can\'92t put it more clearly,\'94 Alice replied very politely, \'93for I can\'92t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\'94\
\'93It isn\'92t,\'94 said the Caterpillar.\
\'93Well, perhaps you haven\'92t found it so yet,\'94 said Alice; \'93but when you have to turn into a chrysalis\'97you will some day, you know\'97and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you\'92ll feel it a little queer, won\'92t you?\'94\
\'93Not a bit,\'94 said the Caterpillar.\
\'93Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,\'94 said Alice; \'93all I know is, it would feel very queer to\'a0
\f1\i me
\f0\i0 .\'94\
\'93You!\'94 said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \'93Who are\'a0
\f1\i you?
\f0\i0 \'94\
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\'92s making such\'a0
\f1\i very
\f0\i0 \'a0short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \'93I think, you ought to tell me who\'a0
\f1\i you
\f0\i0 \'a0are, first.\'94\
\'93Why?\'94 said the Caterpillar.\
Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a\'a0
\f1\i very
\f0\i0 \'a0unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.\
\'93Come back!\'94 the Caterpillar called after her. \'93I\'92ve something important to say!\'94\
This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\
\'93Keep your temper,\'94 said the Caterpillar.\
\'93Is that all?\'94 said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.\
\'93No,\'94 said the Caterpillar.\
Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \'93So you think you\'92re changed, do you?\'94\
\'93I\'92m afraid I am, sir,\'94 said Alice; \'93I can\'92t remember things as I used\'97and I don\'92t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\'94\
\'93Can\'92t remember\'a0
\f1\i what
\f0\i0 \'a0things?\'94 said the Caterpillar.\
\'93Well, I\'92ve tried to say \'93How doth the little busy bee,\'94 but it all came different!\'94 Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\
\'93Repeat, \'93
\f1\i You are old, Father William
\f0\i0 ,\'92\'94 said the Caterpillar.\
Alice folded her hands, and began:\'97\
\pard\pardeftab720\li1405\fi-1405\sa288\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf0 \'93You are old, Father William,\'94 the young man said,\uc0\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'93And your hair has become very white;\u8232 And yet you incessantly stand on your head\'97\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0Do you think, at your age, it is right?\'94\u8232 \u8232 \'93In my youth,\'94 Father William replied to his son,\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'93I feared it might injure the brain;\u8232 But, now that I\'92m perfectly sure I have none,\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0Why, I do it again and again.\'94\u8232 \u8232 \'93You are old,\'94 said the youth, \'93as I mentioned before,\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0And have grown most uncommonly fat;\u8232 Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door\'97\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0Pray, what is the reason of that?\'94\u8232 \u8232 \'93In my youth,\'94 said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'93I kept all my limbs very supple\u8232 By the use of this ointment\'97one shilling the box\'97\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0Allow me to sell you a couple?\'94\u8232 \u8232 \'93You are old,\'94 said the youth, \'93and your jaws are too weak\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0For anything tougher than suet;\u8232 Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak\'97\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0Pray, how did you manage to do it?\'94\u8232 \u8232 \'93In my youth,\'94 said his father, \'93I took to the law,\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0And argued each case with my wife;\u8232 And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0Has lasted the rest of my life.\'94\u8232 \u8232 \'93You are old,\'94 said the youth, \'93one would hardly suppose\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0That your eye was as steady as ever;\u8232 Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\'97\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0What made you so awfully clever?\'94\u8232 \u8232 \'93I have answered three questions, and that is enough,\'94\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0Said his father; \'93don\'92t give yourself airs!\u8232 Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0Be off, or I\'92ll kick you down stairs!\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 \'93That is not said right,\'94 said the Caterpillar.\
\'93Not\'a0
\f1\i quite
\f0\i0 \'a0right, I\'92m afraid,\'94 said Alice, timidly; \'93some of the words have got altered.\'94\
\'93It is wrong from beginning to end,\'94 said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.\
The Caterpillar was the first to speak.\
\'93What size do you want to be?\'94 it asked.\
\'93Oh, I\'92m not particular as to size,\'94 Alice hastily replied; \'93only one doesn\'92t like changing so often, you know.\'94\
\'93I\'a0
\f1\i don\'92t
\f0\i0 \'a0know,\'94 said the Caterpillar.\
Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\
\'93Are you content now?\'94 said the Caterpillar.\
\'93Well, I should like to be a\'a0
\f1\i little
\f0\i0 \'a0larger, sir, if you wouldn\'92t mind,\'94 said Alice: \'93three inches is such a wretched height to be.\'94\
\'93It is a very good height indeed!\'94 said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\
\'93But I\'92m not used to it!\'94 pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, \'93I wish the creatures wouldn\'92t be so easily offended!\'94\
\'93You\'92ll get used to it in time,\'94 said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, \'93One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\'94\
\'93One side of\'a0
\f1\i what?
\f0\i0 \'a0The other side of\'a0
\f1\i what?
\f0\i0 \'94 thought Alice to herself.\
\'93Of the mushroom,\'94 said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.\
\'93And now which is which?\'94 she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\
She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.\

\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0
\AppleTypeServices \cf0 \'93Come, my head\'92s free at last!\'94 said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\
\'93What\'a0
\f1\i can
\f0\i0 \'a0all that green stuff be?\'94 said Alice. \'93And where\'a0
\f1\i have
\f0\i0 \'a0my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\'92t see you?\'94 She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\
As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.\
\'93Serpent!\'94 screamed the Pigeon.\
\'93I\'92m\'a0
\f1\i not
\f0\i0 \'a0a serpent!\'94 said Alice indignantly. \'93Let me alone!\'94\
\'93Serpent, I say again!\'94 repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, \'93I\'92ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!\'94\
\'93I haven\'92t the least idea what you\'92re talking about,\'94 said Alice.\
\'93I\'92ve tried the roots of trees, and I\'92ve tried banks, and I\'92ve tried hedges,\'94 the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \'93but those serpents! There\'92s no pleasing them!\'94\
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\
\'93As if it wasn\'92t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\'94 said the Pigeon; \'93but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven\'92t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\'94\
\'93I\'92m very sorry you\'92ve been annoyed,\'94 said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.\
\'93And just as I\'92d taken the highest tree in the wood,\'94 continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \'93and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\'94\
\'93But I\'92m\'a0
\f1\i not
\f0\i0 \'a0a serpent, I tell you!\'94 said Alice. \'93I\'92m a\'97I\'92m a\'97\'94\
\'93Well!\'a0
\f1\i What
\f0\i0 \'a0are you?\'94 said the Pigeon. \'93I can see you\'92re trying to invent something!\'94\
\'93I\'97I\'92m a little girl,\'94 said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.\
\'93A likely story indeed!\'94 said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. \'93I\'92ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\'a0
\f1\i one
\f0\i0 \'a0with such a neck as that! No, no! You\'92re a serpent; and there\'92s no use denying it. I suppose you\'92ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!\'94\
\'93I\'a0
\f1\i have
\f0\i0 \'a0tasted eggs, certainly,\'94 said Alice, who was a very truthful child; \'93but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.\'94\
\'93I don\'92t believe it,\'94 said the Pigeon; \'93but if they do, why then they\'92re a kind of serpent, that\'92s all I can say.\'94\
This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \'93You\'92re looking for eggs, I know\'a0
\f1\i that
\f0\i0 \'a0well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you\'92re a little girl or a serpent?\'94\
\'93It matters a good deal to\'a0
\f1\i me
\f0\i0 ,\'94 said Alice hastily; \'93but I\'92m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\'92t want\'a0
\f1\i yours
\f0\i0 : I don\'92t like them raw.\'94\
\'93Well, be off, then!\'94 said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\
It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. \'93Come, there\'92s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I\'92m never sure what I\'92m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I\'92ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden\'97how\'a0
\f1\i is
\f0\i0 \'a0that to be done, I wonder?\'94 As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \'93Whoever lives there,\'94 thought Alice, \'93it\'92ll never do to come upon them\'a0
\f1\i this
\f0\i0 \'a0size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!\'94 So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.\

\fs56 \cf0 CHAPTER VI.\uc0\u8232 Pig and Pepper\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood\'97(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)\'97and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\
The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, \'93For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\'94 The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, \'93From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\'94\
Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\
Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\
Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\
\'93There\'92s no sort of use in knocking,\'94 said the Footman, \'93and that for two reasons. First, because I\'92m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they\'92re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.\'94 And certainly there\'a0
\f1\i was
\f0\i0 \'a0a most extraordinary noise going on within\'97a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\
\'93Please, then,\'94 said Alice, \'93how am I to get in?\'94\
\'93There might be some sense in your knocking,\'94 the Footman went on without attending to her, \'93if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were\'a0
\f1\i inside
\f0\i0 , you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.\'94 He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \'93But perhaps he can\'92t help it,\'94 she said to herself; \'93his eyes are so\'a0
\f1\i very
\f0\i0 \'a0nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.\'97How am I to get in?\'94 she repeated, aloud.\
\'93I shall sit here,\'94 the Footman remarked, \'93till tomorrow\'97\'94\
At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman\'92s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\
\'93\'97or next day, maybe,\'94 the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.\
\'93How am I to get in?\'94 asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\
\'93
\f1\i Are
\f0\i0 \'a0you to get in at all?\'94 said the Footman. \'93That\'92s the first question, you know.\'94\
It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. \'93It\'92s really dreadful,\'94 she muttered to herself, \'93the way all the creatures argue. It\'92s enough to drive one crazy!\'94\
The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. \'93I shall sit here,\'94 he said, \'93on and off, for days and days.\'94\
\'93But what am\'a0
\f1\i I
\f0\i0 \'a0to do?\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Anything you like,\'94 said the Footman, and began whistling.\
\'93Oh, there\'92s no use in talking to him,\'94 said Alice desperately: \'93he\'92s perfectly idiotic!\'94 And she opened the door and went in.\
The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\
\'93There\'92s certainly too much pepper in that soup!\'94 Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.\
There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment\'92s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\
\'93Please would you tell me,\'94 said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \'93why your cat grins like that?\'94\
\'93It\'92s a Cheshire cat,\'94 said the Duchess, \'93and that\'92s why. Pig!\'94\
She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:\'97\
\'93I didn\'92t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn\'92t know that cats\'a0
\f1\i could
\f0\i0 \'a0grin.\'94\
\'93They all can,\'94 said the Duchess; \'93and most of \'92em do.\'94\
\'93I don\'92t know of any that do,\'94 Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.\
\'93You don\'92t know much,\'94 said the Duchess; \'93and that\'92s a fact.\'94\
Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby\'97the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\
\'93Oh,\'a0
\f1\i please
\f0\i0 \'a0mind what you\'92re doing!\'94 cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. \'93Oh, there goes his\'a0
\f1\i precious
\f0\i0 \'a0nose!\'94 as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.\
\'93If everybody minded their own business,\'94 the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, \'93the world would go round a deal faster than it does.\'94\
\'93Which would\'a0
\f1\i not
\f0\i0 \'a0be an advantage,\'94 said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. \'93Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis\'97\'94\
\'93Talking of axes,\'94 said the Duchess, \'93chop off her head!\'94\
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: \'93Twenty-four hours, I\'a0
\f1\i think
\f0\i0 ; or is it twelve? I\'97\'94\
\'93Oh, don\'92t bother\'a0
\f1\i me
\f0\i0 ,\'94 said the Duchess; \'93I never could abide figures!\'94 And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:\

\fs24 \cf0 While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:\'97\

\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 \'93Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\'94 the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \'93I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\'94 and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, \'93just like a star-fish,\'94 thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\
As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. \'93If I don\'92t take this child away with me,\'94 thought Alice, \'93they\'92re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn\'92t it be murder to leave it behind?\'94 She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). \'93Don\'92t grunt,\'94 said Alice; \'93that\'92s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.\'94\
The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a\'a0
\f1\i very
\f0\i0 \'a0turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. \'93But perhaps it was only sobbing,\'94 she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.\
No, there were no tears. \'93If you\'92re going to turn into a pig, my dear,\'94 said Alice, seriously, \'93I\'92ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!\'94 The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\
Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \'93Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?\'94 when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be\'a0
\f1\i no
\f0\i0 \'a0mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.\
So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. \'93If it had grown up,\'94 she said to herself, \'93it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.\'94 And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, \'93if one only knew the right way to change them\'97\'94 when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.\
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had\'a0
\f1\i very
\f0\i0 \'a0long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.\
\'93Cheshire Puss,\'94 she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. \'93Come, it\'92s pleased so far,\'94 thought Alice, and she went on. \'93Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\'94\
\'93That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\'94 said the Cat.\
\'93I don\'92t much care where\'97\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Then it doesn\'92t matter which way you go,\'94 said the Cat.\
\'93\'97so long as I get\'a0
\f1\i somewhere
\f0\i0 ,\'94 Alice added as an explanation.\
\'93Oh, you\'92re sure to do that,\'94 said the Cat, \'93if you only walk long enough.\'94\
Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. \'93What sort of people live about here?\'94\
\'93In\'a0
\f1\i that
\f0\i0 \'a0direction,\'94 the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \'93lives a Hatter: and in\'a0
\f1\i that
\f0\i0 \'a0direction,\'94 waving the other paw, \'93lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they\'92re both mad.\'94\
\'93But I don\'92t want to go among mad people,\'94 Alice remarked.\
\'93Oh, you can\'92t help that,\'94 said the Cat: \'93we\'92re all mad here. I\'92m mad. You\'92re mad.\'94\
\'93How do you know I\'92m mad?\'94 said Alice.\
\'93You must be,\'94 said the Cat, \'93or you wouldn\'92t have come here.\'94\
Alice didn\'92t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \'93And how do you know that you\'92re mad?\'94\
\'93To begin with,\'94 said the Cat, \'93a dog\'92s not mad. You grant that?\'94\
\'93I suppose so,\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Well, then,\'94 the Cat went on, \'93you see, a dog growls when it\'92s angry, and wags its tail when it\'92s pleased. Now\'a0
\f1\i I
\f0\i0 \'a0growl when I\'92m pleased, and wag my tail when I\'92m angry. Therefore I\'92m mad.\'94\
\'93
\f1\i I
\f0\i0 \'a0call it purring, not growling,\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Call it what you like,\'94 said the Cat. \'93Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\'94\
\'93I should like it very much,\'94 said Alice, \'93but I haven\'92t been invited yet.\'94\
\'93You\'92ll see me there,\'94 said the Cat, and vanished.\
Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.\
\'93By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\'94 said the Cat. \'93I\'92d nearly forgotten to ask.\'94\
\'93It turned into a pig,\'94 Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.\
\'93I thought it would,\'94 said the Cat, and vanished again.\
Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. \'93I\'92ve seen hatters before,\'94 she said to herself; \'93the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won\'92t be raving mad\'97at least not so mad as it was in March.\'94 As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.\
\'93Did you say pig, or fig?\'94 said the Cat.\
\'93I said pig,\'94 replied Alice; \'93and I wish you wouldn\'92t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\'94\
\'93All right,\'94 said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.\
\'93Well! I\'92ve often seen a cat without a grin,\'94 thought Alice; \'93but a grin without a cat! It\'92s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\'94\
She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself \'93Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I\'92d gone to see the Hatter instead!\'94\

\fs56 \cf0 CHAPTER VII.\uc0\u8232 A Mad Tea-Party\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \'93Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,\'94 thought Alice; \'93only, as it\'92s asleep, I suppose it doesn\'92t mind.\'94\
The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: \'93No room! No room!\'94 they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \'93There\'92s\'a0
\f1\i plenty
\f0\i0 \'a0of room!\'94 said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\
\'93Have some wine,\'94 the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\
Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. \'93I don\'92t see any wine,\'94 she remarked.\
\'93There isn\'92t any,\'94 said the March Hare.\
\'93Then it wasn\'92t very civil of you to offer it,\'94 said Alice angrily.\
\'93It wasn\'92t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\'94 said the March Hare.\
\'93I didn\'92t know it was\'a0
\f1\i your
\f0\i0 \'a0table,\'94 said Alice; \'93it\'92s laid for a great many more than three.\'94\
\'93Your hair wants cutting,\'94 said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.\
\'93You should learn not to make personal remarks,\'94 Alice said with some severity; \'93it\'92s very rude.\'94\
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he\'a0
\f1\i said
\f0\i0 \'a0was, \'93Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\'94\
\'93Come, we shall have some fun now!\'94 thought Alice. \'93I\'92m glad they\'92ve begun asking riddles.\'97I believe I can guess that,\'94 she added aloud.\
\'93Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\'94 said the March Hare.\
\'93Exactly so,\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Then you should say what you mean,\'94 the March Hare went on.\
\'93I do,\'94 Alice hastily replied; \'93at least\'97at least I mean what I say\'97that\'92s the same thing, you know.\'94\
\'93Not the same thing a bit!\'94 said the Hatter. \'93You might just as well say that \'91I see what I eat\'92 is the same thing as \'91I eat what I see\'92!\'94\
\'93You might just as well say,\'94 added the March Hare, \'93that \'91I like what I get\'92 is the same thing as \'91I get what I like\'92!\'94\
\'93You might just as well say,\'94 added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, \'93that \'91I breathe when I sleep\'92 is the same thing as \'91I sleep when I breathe\'92!\'94\
\'93It\'a0
\f1\i is
\f0\i0 \'a0the same thing with you,\'94 said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn\'92t much.\
The Hatter was the first to break the silence. \'93What day of the month is it?\'94 he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.\
Alice considered a little, and then said \'93The fourth.\'94\
\'93Two days wrong!\'94 sighed the Hatter. \'93I told you butter wouldn\'92t suit the works!\'94 he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\
\'93It was the\'a0
\f1\i best
\f0\i0 \'a0butter,\'94 the March Hare meekly replied.\
\'93Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\'94 the Hatter grumbled: \'93you shouldn\'92t have put it in with the bread-knife.\'94\
The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, \'93It was the\'a0
\f1\i best
\f0\i0 \'a0butter, you know.\'94\
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \'93What a funny watch!\'94 she remarked. \'93It tells the day of the month, and doesn\'92t tell what o\'92clock it is!\'94\
\'93Why should it?\'94 muttered the Hatter. \'93Does\'a0
\f1\i your
\f0\i0 \'a0watch tell you what year it is?\'94\
\'93Of course not,\'94 Alice replied very readily: \'93but that\'92s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.\'94\
\'93Which is just the case with\'a0
\f1\i mine
\f0\i0 ,\'94 said the Hatter.\
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter\'92s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \'93I don\'92t quite understand you,\'94 she said, as politely as she could.\
\'93The Dormouse is asleep again,\'94 said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.\
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, \'93Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\'94\
\'93Have you guessed the riddle yet?\'94 the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.\
\'93No, I give it up,\'94 Alice replied: \'93what\'92s the answer?\'94\
\'93I haven\'92t the slightest idea,\'94 said the Hatter.\
\'93Nor I,\'94 said the March Hare.\
Alice sighed wearily. \'93I think you might do something better with the time,\'94 she said, \'93than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.\'94\
\'93If you knew Time as well as I do,\'94 said the Hatter, \'93you wouldn\'92t talk about wasting\'a0
\f1\i it
\f0\i0 . It\'92s\'a0
\f1\i him
\f0\i0 .\'94\
\'93I don\'92t know what you mean,\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Of course you don\'92t!\'94 the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. \'93I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\'94\
\'93Perhaps not,\'94 Alice cautiously replied: \'93but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.\'94\
\'93Ah! that accounts for it,\'94 said the Hatter. \'93He won\'92t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\'92d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o\'92clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you\'92d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!\'94\
(\'93I only wish it was,\'94 the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\
\'93That would be grand, certainly,\'94 said Alice thoughtfully: \'93but then\'97I shouldn\'92t be hungry for it, you know.\'94\
\'93Not at first, perhaps,\'94 said the Hatter: \'93but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.\'94\
\'93Is that the way\'a0
\f1\i you
\f0\i0 \'a0manage?\'94 Alice asked.\
The Hatter shook his head mournfully. \'93Not I!\'94 he replied. \'93We quarrelled last March\'97just before\'a0
\f1\i he
\f0\i0 \'a0went mad, you know\'97\'94 (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \'93\'97it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\
\pard\pardeftab720\li1405\fi-1405\sa288\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf0 \'91Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\uc0\u8232 How I wonder what you\'92re at!\'92\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 You know the song, perhaps?\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93I\'92ve heard something like it,\'94 said Alice.\
\'93It goes on, you know,\'94 the Hatter continued, \'93in this way:\'97\
\pard\pardeftab720\li1405\fi-1405\sa288\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf0 \'91Up above the world you fly,\uc0\u8232 Like a tea-tray in the sky.\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0Twinkle, twinkle\'97\'92\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep \'93
\f1\i Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
\f0\i0 \'97\'94 and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.\
\'93Well, I\'92d hardly finished the first verse,\'94 said the Hatter, \'93when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, \'91He\'92s murdering the time! Off with his head!\'92\'94\
\'93How dreadfully savage!\'94 exclaimed Alice.\
\'93And ever since that,\'94 the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \'93he won\'92t do a thing I ask! It\'92s always six o\'92clock now.\'94\
A bright idea came into Alice\'92s head. \'93Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?\'94 she asked.\
\'93Yes, that\'92s it,\'94 said the Hatter with a sigh: \'93it\'92s always tea-time, and we\'92ve no time to wash the things between whiles.\'94\
\'93Then you keep moving round, I suppose?\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Exactly so,\'94 said the Hatter: \'93as the things get used up.\'94\
\'93But what happens when you come to the beginning again?\'94 Alice ventured to ask.\
\'93Suppose we change the subject,\'94 the March Hare interrupted, yawning. \'93I\'92m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\'94\
\'93I\'92m afraid I don\'92t know one,\'94 said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.\
\'93Then the Dormouse shall!\'94 they both cried. \'93Wake up, Dormouse!\'94 And they pinched it on both sides at once.\
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \'93I wasn\'92t asleep,\'94 he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: \'93I heard every word you fellows were saying.\'94\
\'93Tell us a story!\'94 said the March Hare.\
\'93Yes, please do!\'94 pleaded Alice.\
\'93And be quick about it,\'94 added the Hatter, \'93or you\'92ll be asleep again before it\'92s done.\'94\
\'93Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\'94 the Dormouse began in a great hurry; \'93and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well\'97\'94\
\'93What did they live on?\'94 said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking.\
\'93They lived on treacle,\'94 said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.\
\'93They couldn\'92t have done that, you know,\'94 Alice gently remarked; \'93they\'92d have been ill.\'94\
\'93So they were,\'94 said the Dormouse; \'93
\f1\i very
\f0\i0 \'a0ill.\'94\
Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \'93But why did they live at the bottom of a well?\'94\
\'93Take some more tea,\'94 the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\
\'93I\'92ve had nothing yet,\'94 Alice replied in an offended tone, \'93so I can\'92t take more.\'94\
\'93You mean you can\'92t take\'a0
\f1\i less
\f0\i0 ,\'94 said the Hatter: \'93it\'92s very easy to take\'a0
\f1\i more
\f0\i0 \'a0than nothing.\'94\
\'93Nobody asked\'a0
\f1\i your
\f0\i0 \'a0opinion,\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Who\'92s making personal remarks now?\'94 the Hatter asked triumphantly.\
Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question. \'93Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\'94\
The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, \'93It was a treacle-well.\'94\
\'93There\'92s no such thing!\'94 Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went \'93Sh! sh!\'94 and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, \'93If you can\'92t be civil, you\'92d better finish the story for yourself.\'94\
\'93No, please go on!\'94 Alice said very humbly; \'93I won\'92t interrupt again. I dare say there may be\'a0
\f1\i one
\f0\i0 .\'94\
\'93One, indeed!\'94 said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on. \'93And so these three little sisters\'97they were learning to draw, you know\'97\'94\
\'93What did they draw?\'94 said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\
\'93Treacle,\'94 said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\
\'93I want a clean cup,\'94 interrupted the Hatter: \'93let\'92s all move one place on.\'94\
He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse\'92s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: \'93But I don\'92t understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?\'94\
\'93You can draw water out of a water-well,\'94 said the Hatter; \'93so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well\'97eh, stupid?\'94\
\'93But they were\'a0
\f1\i in
\f0\i0 \'a0the well,\'94 Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.\
\'93Of course they were,\'94 said the Dormouse; \'93\'97well in.\'94\
This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.\
\'93They were learning to draw,\'94 the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \'93and they drew all manner of things\'97everything that begins with an M\'97\'94\
\'93Why with an M?\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Why not?\'94 said the March Hare.\
Alice was silent.\
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: \'93\'97that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness\'97you know you say things are \'93much of a muchness\'94\'97did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?\'94\
\'93Really, now you ask me,\'94 said Alice, very much confused, \'93I don\'92t think\'97\'94\
\'93Then you shouldn\'92t talk,\'94 said the Hatter.\
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.\
\'93At any rate I\'92ll never go\'a0
\f1\i there
\f0\i0 \'a0again!\'94 said Alice as she picked her way through the wood. \'93It\'92s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!\'94\
Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. \'93That\'92s very curious!\'94 she thought. \'93But everything\'92s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.\'94 And in she went.\
Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. \'93Now, I\'92ll manage better this time,\'94 she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and\'a0
\f1\i then
\f0\i0 \'97she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.\

\fs56 \cf0 CHAPTER VIII.\uc0\u8232 The Queen\'92s Croquet-Ground\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, \'93Look out now, Five! Don\'92t go splashing paint over me like that!\'94\
\'93I couldn\'92t help it,\'94 said Five, in a sulky tone; \'93Seven jogged my elbow.\'94\
On which Seven looked up and said, \'93That\'92s right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!\'94\
\'93
\f1\i You\'92d
\f0\i0 \'a0better not talk!\'94 said Five. \'93I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!\'94\
\'93What for?\'94 said the one who had spoken first.\
\'93That\'92s none of\'a0
\f1\i your
\f0\i0 \'a0business, Two!\'94 said Seven.\
\'93Yes, it\'a0
\f1\i is
\f0\i0 \'a0his business!\'94 said Five, \'93and I\'92ll tell him\'97it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.\'94\
Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun \'93Well, of all the unjust things\'97\'94 when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.\
\'93Would you tell me,\'94 said Alice, a little timidly, \'93why you are painting those roses?\'94\
Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, \'93Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\'a0
\f1\i red
\f0\i0 \'a0rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we\'92re doing our best, afore she comes, to\'97\'94 At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out \'93The Queen! The Queen!\'94 and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\
First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\'92s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; \'93and besides, what would be the use of a procession,\'94 thought she, \'93if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn\'92t see it?\'94 So she stood still where she was, and waited.\
When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely \'93Who is this?\'94 She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\
\'93Idiot!\'94 said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, \'93What\'92s your name, child?\'94\
\'93My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\'94 said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, \'93Why, they\'92re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn\'92t be afraid of them!\'94\
\'93And who are\'a0
\f1\i these?
\f0\i0 \'94 said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.\
\'93How should\'a0
\f1\i I
\f0\i0 \'a0know?\'94 said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \'93It\'92s no business of\'a0
\f1\i mine
\f0\i0 .\'94\
The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed \'93Off with her head! Off\'97\'94\
\'93Nonsense!\'94 said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.\
The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \'93Consider, my dear: she is only a child!\'94\
The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \'93Turn them over!\'94\
The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\
\'93Get up!\'94 said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.\
\'93Leave off that!\'94 screamed the Queen. \'93You make me giddy.\'94 And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, \'93What\'a0
\f1\i have
\f0\i0 \'a0you been doing here?\'94\
\'93May it please your Majesty,\'94 said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, \'93we were trying\'97\'94\
\'93
\f1\i I
\f0\i0 \'a0see!\'94 said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. \'93Off with their heads!\'94 and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.\
\'93You shan\'92t be beheaded!\'94 said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.\
\'93Are their heads off?\'94 shouted the Queen.\
\'93Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\'94 the soldiers shouted in reply.\
\'93That\'92s right!\'94 shouted the Queen. \'93Can you play croquet?\'94\
The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her.\
\'93Yes!\'94 shouted Alice.\
\'93Come on, then!\'94 roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.\
\'93It\'92s\'97it\'92s a very fine day!\'94 said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\
\'93Very,\'94 said Alice: \'93\'97where\'92s the Duchess?\'94\
\'93Hush! Hush!\'94 said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered \'93She\'92s under sentence of execution.\'94\
\'93What for?\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Did you say \'91What a pity!\'92?\'94 the Rabbit asked.\
\'93No, I didn\'92t,\'94 said Alice: \'93I don\'92t think it\'92s at all a pity. I said \'91What for?\'92\'94\
\'93She boxed the Queen\'92s ears\'97\'94 the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter. \'93Oh, hush!\'94 the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. \'93The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said\'97\'94\
\'93Get to your places!\'94 shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it\'a0
\f1\i would
\f0\i0 \'a0twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\
The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting \'93Off with his head!\'94 or \'93Off with her head!\'94 about once in a minute.\
Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, \'93and then,\'94 thought she, \'93what would become of me? They\'92re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there\'92s any one left alive!\'94\
She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself \'93It\'92s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.\'94\
\'93How are you getting on?\'94 said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.\
Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \'93It\'92s no use speaking to it,\'94 she thought, \'93till its ears have come, or at least one of them.\'94 In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\
\'93I don\'92t think they play at all fairly,\'94 Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, \'93and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\'92t hear oneself speak\'97and they don\'92t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them\'97and you\'92ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\'92s the arch I\'92ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground\'97and I should have croqueted the Queen\'92s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!\'94\
\'93How do you like the Queen?\'94 said the Cat in a low voice.\
\'93Not at all,\'94 said Alice: \'93she\'92s so extremely\'97\'94 Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, \'93\'97likely to win, that it\'92s hardly worth while finishing the game.\'94\
The Queen smiled and passed on.\
\'93Who\'a0
\f1\i are
\f0\i0 \'a0you talking to?\'94 said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat\'92s head with great curiosity.\
\'93It\'92s a friend of mine\'97a Cheshire Cat,\'94 said Alice: \'93allow me to introduce it.\'94\
\'93I don\'92t like the look of it at all,\'94 said the King: \'93however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.\'94\
\'93I\'92d rather not,\'94 the Cat remarked.\
\'93Don\'92t be impertinent,\'94 said the King, \'93and don\'92t look at me like that!\'94 He got behind Alice as he spoke.\
\'93A cat may look at a king,\'94 said Alice. \'93I\'92ve read that in some book, but I don\'92t remember where.\'94\
\'93Well, it must be removed,\'94 said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, \'93My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!\'94\
The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. \'93Off with his head!\'94 she said, without even looking round.\
\'93I\'92ll fetch the executioner myself,\'94 said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.\
Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen\'92s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\
By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \'93but it doesn\'92t matter much,\'94 thought Alice, \'93as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.\'94 So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.\
When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\
The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.\
The executioner\'92s argument was, that you couldn\'92t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn\'92t going to begin at\'a0
\f1\i his
\f0\i0 \'a0time of life.\
The King\'92s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren\'92t to talk nonsense.\
The Queen\'92s argument was, that if something wasn\'92t done about it in less than no time she\'92d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)\
Alice could think of nothing else to say but \'93It belongs to the Duchess: you\'92d better ask\'a0
\f1\i her
\f0\i0 \'a0about it.\'94\
\'93She\'92s in prison,\'94 the Queen said to the executioner: \'93fetch her here.\'94 And the executioner went off like an arrow.\
The Cat\'92s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.\

\fs56 \cf0 CHAPTER IX.\uc0\u8232 The Mock Turtle\'92s Story\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 \'93You can\'92t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\'94 said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice\'92s, and they walked off together.\
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.\
\'93When\'a0
\f1\i I\'92m
\f0\i0 \'a0a Duchess,\'94 she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), \'93I won\'92t have any pepper in my kitchen\'a0
\f1\i at all
\f0\i0 . Soup does very well without\'97Maybe it\'92s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,\'94 she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, \'93and vinegar that makes them sour\'97and camomile that makes them bitter\'97and\'97and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew\'a0
\f1\i that
\f0\i0 : then they wouldn\'92t be so stingy about it, you know\'97\'94\
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. \'93You\'92re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can\'92t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.\'94\
\'93Perhaps it hasn\'92t one,\'94 Alice ventured to remark.\
\'93Tut, tut, child!\'94 said the Duchess. \'93Everything\'92s got a moral, if only you can find it.\'94 And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice\'92s side as she spoke.\
Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was\'a0
\f1\i very
\f0\i0 \'a0ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice\'92s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.\
\'93The game\'92s going on rather better now,\'94 she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.\
\'93\'92Tis so,\'94 said the Duchess: \'93and the moral of that is\'97\'91Oh, \'92tis love, \'92tis love, that makes the world go round!\'92\'94\
\'93Somebody said,\'94 Alice whispered, \'93that it\'92s done by everybody minding their own business!\'94\
\'93Ah, well! It means much the same thing,\'94 said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice\'92s shoulder as she added, \'93and the moral of\'a0
\f1\i that
\f0\i0 \'a0is\'97\'91Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.\'92\'94\
\'93How fond she is of finding morals in things!\'94 Alice thought to herself.\
\'93I dare say you\'92re wondering why I don\'92t put my arm round your waist,\'94 the Duchess said after a pause: \'93the reason is, that I\'92m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?\'94\
\'93He might bite,\'94 Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.\
\'93Very true,\'94 said the Duchess: \'93flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is\'97\'91Birds of a feather flock together.\'92\'94\
\'93Only mustard isn\'92t a bird,\'94 Alice remarked.\
\'93Right, as usual,\'94 said the Duchess: \'93what a clear way you have of putting things!\'94\
\'93It\'92s a mineral, I\'a0
\f1\i think
\f0\i0 ,\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Of course it is,\'94 said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; \'93there\'92s a large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is\'97\'91The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.\'92\'94\
\'93Oh, I know!\'94 exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, \'93it\'92s a vegetable. It doesn\'92t look like one, but it is.\'94\
\'93I quite agree with you,\'94 said the Duchess; \'93and the moral of that is\'97\'91Be what you would seem to be\'92\'97or if you\'92d like it put more simply\'97\'91Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.\'92\'94\
\'93I think I should understand that better,\'94 Alice said very politely, \'93if I had it written down: but I can\'92t quite follow it as you say it.\'94\
\'93That\'92s nothing to what I could say if I chose,\'94 the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.\
\'93Pray don\'92t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Oh, don\'92t talk about trouble!\'94 said the Duchess. \'93I make you a present of everything I\'92ve said as yet.\'94\
\'93A cheap sort of present!\'94 thought Alice. \'93I\'92m glad they don\'92t give birthday presents like that!\'94 But she did not venture to say it out loud.\
\'93Thinking again?\'94 the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.\
\'93I\'92ve a right to think,\'94 said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.\
\'93Just about as much right,\'94 said the Duchess, \'93as pigs have to fly; and the m\'97\'94\
But here, to Alice\'92s great surprise, the Duchess\'92s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word \'91moral,\'92 and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.\
\'93A fine day, your Majesty!\'94 the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\
\'93Now, I give you fair warning,\'94 shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; \'93either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!\'94\
The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\
\'93Let\'92s go on with the game,\'94 the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground.\
The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen\'92s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment\'92s delay would cost them their lives.\
All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting \'93Off with his head!\'94 or \'93Off with her head!\'94 Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.\
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \'93Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?\'94\
\'93No,\'94 said Alice. \'93I don\'92t even know what a Mock Turtle is.\'94\
\'93It\'92s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\'94 said the Queen.\
\'93I never saw one, or heard of one,\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Come on, then,\'94 said the Queen, \'93and he shall tell you his history,\'94\
As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, \'93You are all pardoned.\'94 \'93Come,\'a0
\f1\i that\'92s
\f0\i0 \'a0a good thing!\'94 she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.\
They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you don\'92t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \'93Up, lazy thing!\'94 said the Queen, \'93and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered;\'94 and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.\
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. \'93What fun!\'94 said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.\
\'93What\'a0
\f1\i is
\f0\i0 \'a0the fun?\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Why,\'a0
\f1\i she
\f0\i0 ,\'94 said the Gryphon. \'93It\'92s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!\'94\
\'93Everybody says \'91come on!\'92 here,\'94 thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: \'93I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\'94\
They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. \'93What is his sorrow?\'94 she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \'93It\'92s all his fancy, that: he hasn\'92t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!\'94\
So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.\
\'93This here young lady,\'94 said the Gryphon, \'93she wants for to know your history, she do.\'94\
\'93I\'92ll tell it her,\'94 said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: \'93sit down, both of you, and don\'92t speak a word till I\'92ve finished.\'94\
So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, \'93I don\'92t see how he can\'a0
\f1\i ever
\f0\i0 \'a0finish, if he doesn\'92t begin.\'94 But she waited patiently.\
\'93Once,\'94 said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, \'93I was a real Turtle.\'94\
These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of \'93Hjckrrh!\'94 from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, \'93Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,\'94 but she could not help thinking there\'a0
\f1\i must
\f0\i0 \'a0be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.\
\'93When we were little,\'94 the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, \'93we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle\'97we used to call him Tortoise\'97\'94\
\'93Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn\'92t one?\'94 Alice asked.\
\'93We called him Tortoise because he taught us,\'94 said the Mock Turtle angrily: \'93really you are very dull!\'94\
\'93You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,\'94 added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, \'93Drive on, old fellow! Don\'92t be all day about it!\'94 and he went on in these words:\
\'93Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn\'92t believe it\'97\'94\
\'93I never said I didn\'92t!\'94 interrupted Alice.\
\'93You did,\'94 said the Mock Turtle.\
\'93Hold your tongue!\'94 added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on.\
\'93We had the best of educations\'97in fact, we went to school every day\'97\'94\
\'93
\f1\i I\'92ve
\f0\i0 \'a0been to a day-school, too,\'94 said Alice; \'93you needn\'92t be so proud as all that.\'94\
\'93With extras?\'94 asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Alice, \'93we learned French and music.\'94\
\'93And washing?\'94 said the Mock Turtle.\
\'93Certainly not!\'94 said Alice indignantly.\
\'93Ah! then yours wasn\'92t a really good school,\'94 said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. \'93Now at\'a0
\f1\i ours
\f0\i0 \'a0they had at the end of the bill, \'91French, music,\'a0
\f1\i and washing
\f0\i0 \'97extra.\'92\'94\
\'93You couldn\'92t have wanted it much,\'94 said Alice; \'93living at the bottom of the sea.\'94\
\'93I couldn\'92t afford to learn it.\'94 said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. \'93I only took the regular course.\'94\
\'93What was that?\'94 inquired Alice.\
\'93Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,\'94 the Mock Turtle replied; \'93and then the different branches of Arithmetic\'97Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.\'94\
\'93I never heard of \'91Uglification,\'92\'94 Alice ventured to say. \'93What is it?\'94\
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. \'93What! Never heard of uglifying!\'94 it exclaimed. \'93You know what to beautify is, I suppose?\'94\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Alice doubtfully: \'93it means\'97to\'97make\'97anything\'97prettier.\'94\
\'93Well, then,\'94 the Gryphon went on, \'93if you don\'92t know what to uglify is, you\'a0
\f1\i are
\f0\i0 \'a0a simpleton.\'94\
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said \'93What else had you to learn?\'94\
\'93Well, there was Mystery,\'94 the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, \'93\'97Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling\'97the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week:\'a0
\f1\i he
\f0\i0 \'a0taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.\'94\
\'93What was\'a0
\f1\i that
\f0\i0 \'a0like?\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Well, I can\'92t show it you myself,\'94 the Mock Turtle said: \'93I\'92m too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.\'94\
\'93Hadn\'92t time,\'94 said the Gryphon: \'93I went to the Classics master, though. He was an old crab,\'a0
\f1\i he
\f0\i0 \'a0was.\'94\
\'93I never went to him,\'94 the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \'93he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.\'94\
\'93So he did, so he did,\'94 said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.\
\'93And how many hours a day did you do lessons?\'94 said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.\
\'93Ten hours the first day,\'94 said the Mock Turtle: \'93nine the next, and so on.\'94\
\'93What a curious plan!\'94 exclaimed Alice.\
\'93That\'92s the reason they\'92re called lessons,\'94 the Gryphon remarked: \'93because they lessen from day to day.\'94\
This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. \'93Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?\'94\
\'93Of course it was,\'94 said the Mock Turtle.\
\'93And how did you manage on the twelfth?\'94 Alice went on eagerly.\
\'93That\'92s enough about lessons,\'94 the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: \'93tell her something about the games now.\'94\

\fs56 \cf0 CHAPTER X.\uc0\u8232 The Lobster Quadrille\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. \'93Same as if he had a bone in his throat,\'94 said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:\'97\
\'93You may not have lived much under the sea\'97\'94 (\'93I haven\'92t,\'94 said Alice)\'97\'93and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster\'97\'94 (Alice began to say \'93I once tasted\'97\'94 but checked herself hastily, and said \'93No, never\'94) \'93\'97so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!\'94\
\'93No, indeed,\'94 said Alice. \'93What sort of a dance is it?\'94\
\'93Why,\'94 said the Gryphon, \'93you first form into a line along the sea-shore\'97\'94\
\'93Two lines!\'94 cried the Mock Turtle. \'93Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you\'92ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way\'97\'94\
\'93
\f1\i That
\f0\i0 \'a0generally takes some time,\'94 interrupted the Gryphon.\
\'93\'97you advance twice\'97\'94\
\'93Each with a lobster as a partner!\'94 cried the Gryphon.\
\'93Of course,\'94 the Mock Turtle said: \'93advance twice, set to partners\'97\'94\
\'93\'97change lobsters, and retire in same order,\'94 continued the Gryphon.\
\'93Then, you know,\'94 the Mock Turtle went on, \'93you throw the\'97\'94\
\'93The lobsters!\'94 shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\
\'93\'97as far out to sea as you can\'97\'94\
\'93Swim after them!\'94 screamed the Gryphon.\
\'93Turn a somersault in the sea!\'94 cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.\
\'93Change lobsters again!\'94 yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\
\'93Back to land again, and that\'92s all the first figure,\'94 said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\
\'93It must be a very pretty dance,\'94 said Alice timidly.\
\'93Would you like to see a little of it?\'94 said the Mock Turtle.\
\'93Very much indeed,\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Come, let\'92s try the first figure!\'94 said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. \'93We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?\'94\
\'93Oh,\'a0
\f1\i you
\f0\i0 \'a0sing,\'94 said the Gryphon. \'93I\'92ve forgotten the words.\'94\
So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:\'97\
\pard\pardeftab720\li1405\fi-1405\sa288\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf0 \'93Will you walk a little faster?\'94 said a whiting to a snail.\uc0\u8232 \'93There\'92s a porpoise close behind us, and he\'92s treading on my tail.\u8232 See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\u8232 They are waiting on the shingle\'97will you come and join the dance?\u8232 Will you, won\'92t you, will you, won\'92t you, will you join the dance?\u8232 Will you, won\'92t you, will you, won\'92t you, won\'92t you join the dance?\u8232 \u8232 \'93You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\u8232 When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\'94\u8232 But the snail replied \'93Too far, too far!\'94 and gave a look askance\'97\u8232 Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\u8232 Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\u8232 Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\u8232 \u8232 \'93What matters it how far we go?\'94 his scaly friend replied.\u8232 \'93There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\u8232 The further off from England the nearer is to France\'97\u8232 Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\u8232 Will you, won\'92t you, will you, won\'92t you, will you join the dance?\u8232 Will you, won\'92t you, will you, won\'92t you, won\'92t you join the dance?\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 \'93Thank you, it\'92s a very interesting dance to watch,\'94 said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: \'93and I do so like that curious song about the whiting!\'94\
\'93Oh, as to the whiting,\'94 said the Mock Turtle, \'93they\'97you\'92ve seen them, of course?\'94\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Alice, \'93I\'92ve often seen them at dinn\'97\'94 she checked herself hastily.\
\'93I don\'92t know where Dinn may be,\'94 said the Mock Turtle, \'93but if you\'92ve seen them so often, of course you know what they\'92re like.\'94\
\'93I believe so,\'94 Alice replied thoughtfully. \'93They have their tails in their mouths\'97and they\'92re all over crumbs.\'94\
\'93You\'92re wrong about the crumbs,\'94 said the Mock Turtle: \'93crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they\'a0
\f1\i have
\f0\i0 \'a0their tails in their mouths; and the reason is\'97\'94 here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.\'97\'93Tell her about the reason and all that,\'94 he said to the Gryphon.\
\'93The reason is,\'94 said the Gryphon, \'93that they\'a0
\f1\i would
\f0\i0 \'a0go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn\'92t get them out again. That\'92s all.\'94\
\'93Thank you,\'94 said Alice, \'93it\'92s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.\'94\
\'93I can tell you more than that, if you like,\'94 said the Gryphon. \'93Do you know why it\'92s called a whiting?\'94\
\'93I never thought about it,\'94 said Alice. \'93Why?\'94\
\'93
\f1\i It does the boots and shoes
\f0\i0 ,\'94 the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\
Alice was thoroughly puzzled. \'93Does the boots and shoes!\'94 she repeated in a wondering tone.\
\'93Why, what are\'a0
\f1\i your
\f0\i0 \'a0shoes done with?\'94 said the Gryphon. \'93I mean, what makes them so shiny?\'94\
Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer. \'93They\'92re done with blacking, I believe.\'94\
\'93Boots and shoes under the sea,\'94 the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, \'93are done with a whiting. Now you know.\'94\
\'93And what are they made of?\'94 Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\
\'93Soles and eels, of course,\'94 the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: \'93any shrimp could have told you that.\'94\
\'93If I\'92d been the whiting,\'94 said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, \'93I\'92d have said to the porpoise, \'91Keep back, please: we don\'92t want\'a0
\f1\i you
\f0\i0 \'a0with us!\'92\'94\
\'93They were obliged to have him with them,\'94 the Mock Turtle said: \'93no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\'94\
\'93Wouldn\'92t it really?\'94 said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\
\'93Of course not,\'94 said the Mock Turtle: \'93why, if a fish came to\'a0
\f1\i me
\f0\i0 , and told me he was going a journey, I should say \'91With what porpoise?\'92\'94\
\'93Don\'92t you mean \'91purpose\'92?\'94 said Alice.\
\'93I mean what I say,\'94 the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added \'93Come, let\'92s hear some of\'a0
\f1\i your
\f0\i0 \'a0adventures.\'94\
\'93I could tell you my adventures\'97beginning from this morning,\'94 said Alice a little timidly: \'93but it\'92s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.\'94\
\'93Explain all that,\'94 said the Mock Turtle.\
\'93No, no! The adventures first,\'94 said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: \'93explanations take such a dreadful time.\'94\
So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so\'a0
\f1\i very
\f0\i0 \'a0wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating \'93
\f1\i You are old, Father William
\f0\i0 ,\'94 to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said \'93That\'92s very curious.\'94\
\'93It\'92s all about as curious as it can be,\'94 said the Gryphon.\
\'93It all came different!\'94 the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \'93I should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.\'94 He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.\
\'93Stand up and repeat \'91\'92
\f1\i Tis the voice of the sluggard
\f0\i0 ,\'92\'94 said the Gryphon.\
\'93How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\'94 thought Alice; \'93I might as well be at school at once.\'94 However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:\'97\
\pard\pardeftab720\li1405\fi-1405\sa288\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf0 \'93\'92Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\uc0\u8232 \'93You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\'94\u8232 As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\u8232 Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\'94\u8232 \u8232 [later editions continued as follows\u8232 When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\u8232 And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\u8232 But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\u8232 His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 \'93That\'92s different from what\'a0
\f1\i I
\f0\i0 \'a0used to say when I was a child,\'94 said the Gryphon.\
\'93Well, I never heard it before,\'94 said the Mock Turtle; \'93but it sounds uncommon nonsense.\'94\
Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would\'a0
\f1\i ever
\f0\i0 \'a0happen in a natural way again.\
\'93I should like to have it explained,\'94 said the Mock Turtle.\
\'93She can\'92t explain it,\'94 said the Gryphon hastily. \'93Go on with the next verse.\'94\
\'93But about his toes?\'94 the Mock Turtle persisted. \'93How\'a0
\f1\i could
\f0\i0 \'a0he turn them out with his nose, you know?\'94\
\'93It\'92s the first position in dancing.\'94 Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\
\'93Go on with the next verse,\'94 the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \'93it begins \'91
\f1\i I passed by his garden
\f0\i0 .\'92\'94\
Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:\'97\
\pard\pardeftab720\li1405\fi-1405\sa288\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf0 \'93I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\uc0\u8232 How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie\'97\'94\u8232 \u8232 [later editions continued as follows\u8232 The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\u8232 While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\u8232 When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\u8232 Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\u8232 While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\u8232 And concluded the banquet\'97]\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 \'93What\'a0
\f1\i is
\f0\i0 \'a0the use of repeating all that stuff,\'94 the Mock Turtle interrupted, \'93if you don\'92t explain it as you go on? It\'92s by far the most confusing thing\'a0
\f1\i I
\f0\i0 \'a0ever heard!\'94\
\'93Yes, I think you\'92d better leave off,\'94 said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.\
\'93Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\'94 the Gryphon went on. \'93Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\'94\
\'93Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\'94 Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, \'93Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \'91
\f1\i Turtle Soup
\f0\i0 ,\'92 will you, old fellow?\'94\
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:\'97\

\'93What trial is it?\'94 Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered \'93Come on!\'94 and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:\'97\

\fs56 \cf0 CHAPTER XI.\uc0\u8232 Who Stole the Tarts?\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them\'97all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them\'97\'93I wish they\'92d get the trial done,\'94 she thought, \'93and hand round the refreshments!\'94 But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.\
Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. \'93That\'92s the judge,\'94 she said to herself, \'93because of his great wig.\'94\
The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\
\'93And that\'92s the jury-box,\'94 thought Alice, \'93and those twelve creatures,\'94 (she was obliged to say \'93creatures,\'94 you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) \'93I suppose they are the jurors.\'94 She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, \'93jury-men\'94 would have done just as well.\
The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. \'93What are they doing?\'94 Alice whispered to the Gryphon. \'93They can\'92t have anything to put down yet, before the trial\'92s begun.\'94\
\'93They\'92re putting down their names,\'94 the Gryphon whispered in reply, \'93for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.\'94\
\'93Stupid things!\'94 Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, \'93Silence in the court!\'94 and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.\
Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down \'93stupid things!\'94 on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn\'92t know how to spell \'93stupid,\'94 and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. \'93A nice muddle their slates\'92ll be in before the trial\'92s over!\'94 thought Alice.\
One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could\'a0
\f1\i not
\f0\i0 \'a0stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\
\'93Herald, read the accusation!\'94 said the King.\
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:\'97\
\pard\pardeftab720\li1405\fi-1405\sa288\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf0 \'93The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\uc0\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0All on a summer day:\u8232 The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0And took them quite away!\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 \'93Consider your verdict,\'94 the King said to the jury.\
\'93Not yet, not yet!\'94 the Rabbit hastily interrupted. \'93There\'92s a great deal to come before that!\'94\
\'93Call the first witness,\'94 said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, \'93First witness!\'94\
The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. \'93I beg pardon, your Majesty,\'94 he began, \'93for bringing these in: but I hadn\'92t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.\'94\
\'93You ought to have finished,\'94 said the King. \'93When did you begin?\'94\
The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. \'93Fourteenth of March, I\'a0
\f1\i think
\f0\i0 \'a0it was,\'94 he said.\
\'93Fifteenth,\'94 said the March Hare.\
\'93Sixteenth,\'94 added the Dormouse.\
\'93Write that down,\'94 the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.\
\'93Take off your hat,\'94 the King said to the Hatter.\
\'93It isn\'92t mine,\'94 said the Hatter.\
\'93
\f1\i Stolen!
\f0\i0 \'94 the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.\
\'93I keep them to sell,\'94 the Hatter added as an explanation; \'93I\'92ve none of my own. I\'92m a hatter.\'94\
Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.\
\'93Give your evidence,\'94 said the King; \'93and don\'92t be nervous, or I\'92ll have you executed on the spot.\'94\
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.\
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.\
\'93I wish you wouldn\'92t squeeze so.\'94 said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. \'93I can hardly breathe.\'94\
\'93I can\'92t help it,\'94 said Alice very meekly: \'93I\'92m growing.\'94\
\'93You\'92ve no right to grow\'a0
\f1\i here
\f0\i0 ,\'94 said the Dormouse.\
\'93Don\'92t talk nonsense,\'94 said Alice more boldly: \'93you know you\'92re growing too.\'94\
\'93Yes, but\'a0
\f1\i I
\f0\i0 \'a0grow at a reasonable pace,\'94 said the Dormouse: \'93not in that ridiculous fashion.\'94 And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.\
All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, \'93Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\'94 on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.\
\'93Give your evidence,\'94 the King repeated angrily, \'93or I\'92ll have you executed, whether you\'92re nervous or not.\'94\
\'93I\'92m a poor man, your Majesty,\'94 the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, \'93\'97and I hadn\'92t begun my tea\'97not above a week or so\'97and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin\'97and the twinkling of the tea\'97\'94\
\'93The twinkling of the\'a0
\f1\i what?
\f0\i0 \'94 said the King.\
\'93It\'a0
\f1\i began
\f0\i0 \'a0with the tea,\'94 the Hatter replied.\
\'93Of course twinkling begins with a T!\'94 said the King sharply. \'93Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!\'94\
\'93I\'92m a poor man,\'94 the Hatter went on, \'93and most things twinkled after that\'97only the March Hare said\'97\'94\
\'93I didn\'92t!\'94 the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\
\'93You did!\'94 said the Hatter.\
\'93I deny it!\'94 said the March Hare.\
\'93He denies it,\'94 said the King: \'93leave out that part.\'94\
\'93Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said\'97\'94 the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.\
\'93After that,\'94 continued the Hatter, \'93I cut some more bread-and-butter\'97\'94\
\'93But what did the Dormouse say?\'94 one of the jury asked.\
\'93That I can\'92t remember,\'94 said the Hatter.\
\'93You\'a0
\f1\i must
\f0\i0 \'a0remember,\'94 remarked the King, \'93or I\'92ll have you executed.\'94\
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. \'93I\'92m a poor man, your Majesty,\'94 he began.\
\'93You\'92re a\'a0
\f1\i very
\f0\i0 \'a0poor\'a0
\f1\i speaker
\f0\i0 ,\'94 said the King.\
Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)\
\'93I\'92m glad I\'92ve seen that done,\'94 thought Alice. \'93I\'92ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \'93There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,\'94 and I never understood what it meant till now.\'94\
\'93If that\'92s all you know about it, you may stand down,\'94 continued the King.\
\'93I can\'92t go no lower,\'94 said the Hatter: \'93I\'92m on the floor, as it is.\'94\
\'93Then you may\'a0
\f1\i sit
\f0\i0 \'a0down,\'94 the King replied.\
Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\
\'93Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!\'94 thought Alice. \'93Now we shall get on better.\'94\
\'93I\'92d rather finish my tea,\'94 said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\
\'93You may go,\'94 said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.\
\'93\'97and just take his head off outside,\'94 the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.\
\'93Call the next witness!\'94 said the King.\
The next witness was the Duchess\'92s cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\
\'93Give your evidence,\'94 said the King.\
\'93Shan\'92t,\'94 said the cook.\
The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, \'93Your Majesty must cross-examine\'a0
\f1\i this
\f0\i0 \'a0witness.\'94\
\'93Well, if I must, I must,\'94 the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, \'93What are tarts made of?\'94\
\'93Pepper, mostly,\'94 said the cook.\
\'93Treacle,\'94 said a sleepy voice behind her.\
\'93Collar that Dormouse,\'94 the Queen shrieked out. \'93Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!\'94\
For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.\
\'93Never mind!\'94 said the King, with an air of great relief. \'93Call the next witness.\'94 And he added in an undertone to the Queen, \'93Really, my dear,\'a0
\f1\i you
\f0\i0 \'a0must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!\'94\
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, \'93\'97for they haven\'92t got much evidence\'a0
\f1\i yet
\f0\i0 ,\'94 she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \'93Alice!\'94\

\fs56 \cf0 CHAPTER XII.\uc0\u8232 Alice\'92s Evidence\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 \'93Here!\'94 cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.\
\'93Oh, I\'a0
\f1\i beg
\f0\i0 \'a0your pardon!\'94 she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.\
\'93The trial cannot proceed,\'94 said the King in a very grave voice, \'93until all the jurymen are back in their proper places\'97
\f1\i all
\f0\i0 ,\'94 he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.\
Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; \'93not that it signifies much,\'94 she said to herself; \'93I should think it would be\'a0
\f1\i quite
\f0\i0 \'a0as much use in the trial one way up as the other.\'94\
As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.\
\'93What do you know about this business?\'94 the King said to Alice.\
\'93Nothing,\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Nothing\'a0
\f1\i whatever?
\f0\i0 \'94 persisted the King.\
\'93Nothing whatever,\'94 said Alice.\
\'93That\'92s very important,\'94 the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: \'93
\f1\i Un
\f0\i0 important, your Majesty means, of course,\'94 he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.\
\'93
\f1\i Un
\f0\i0 important, of course, I meant,\'94 the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone,\
\'93important\'97unimportant\'97unimportant\'97important\'97\'94 as if he were trying which word sounded best.\
Some of the jury wrote it down \'93important,\'94 and some \'93unimportant.\'94 Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; \'93but it doesn\'92t matter a bit,\'94 she thought to herself.\
At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out \'93Silence!\'94 and read out from his book, \'93Rule Forty-two.\'a0
\f1\i All persons more than a mile high to leave the court
\f0\i0 .\'94\
Everybody looked at Alice.\
\'93
\f1\i I\'92m
\f0\i0 \'a0not a mile high,\'94 said Alice.\
\'93You are,\'94 said the King.\
\'93Nearly two miles high,\'94 added the Queen.\
\'93Well, I shan\'92t go, at any rate,\'94 said Alice: \'93besides, that\'92s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.\'94\
\'93It\'92s the oldest rule in the book,\'94 said the King.\
\'93Then it ought to be Number One,\'94 said Alice.\
The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. \'93Consider your verdict,\'94 he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\
\'93There\'92s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,\'94 said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; \'93this paper has just been picked up.\'94\
\'93What\'92s in it?\'94 said the Queen.\
\'93I haven\'92t opened it yet,\'94 said the White Rabbit, \'93but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to\'97to somebody.\'94\
\'93It must have been that,\'94 said the King, \'93unless it was written to nobody, which isn\'92t usual, you know.\'94\
\'93Who is it directed to?\'94 said one of the jurymen.\
\'93It isn\'92t directed at all,\'94 said the White Rabbit; \'93in fact, there\'92s nothing written on the\'a0
\f1\i outside
\f0\i0 .\'94 He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added \'93It isn\'92t a letter, after all: it\'92s a set of verses.\'94\
\'93Are they in the prisoner\'92s handwriting?\'94 asked another of the jurymen.\
\'93No, they\'92re not,\'94 said the White Rabbit, \'93and that\'92s the queerest thing about it.\'94 (The jury all looked puzzled.)\
\'93He must have imitated somebody else\'92s hand,\'94 said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.)\
\'93Please your Majesty,\'94 said the Knave, \'93I didn\'92t write it, and they can\'92t prove I did: there\'92s no name signed at the end.\'94\
\'93If you didn\'92t sign it,\'94 said the King, \'93that only makes the matter worse. You\'a0
\f1\i must
\f0\i0 \'a0have meant some mischief, or else you\'92d have signed your name like an honest man.\'94\
There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.\
\'93That\'a0
\f1\i proves
\f0\i0 \'a0his guilt,\'94 said the Queen.\
\'93It proves nothing of the sort!\'94 said Alice. \'93Why, you don\'92t even know what they\'92re about!\'94\
\'93Read them,\'94 said the King.\
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \'93Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?\'94 he asked.\
\'93Begin at the beginning,\'94 the King said gravely, \'93and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\'94\
These were the verses the White Rabbit read:\'97\
\pard\pardeftab720\li1405\fi-1405\sa288\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs28\fsmilli14400 \cf0 \'93They told me you had been to her,\uc0\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0And mentioned me to him:\u8232 She gave me a good character,\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0But said I could not swim.\u8232 \u8232 He sent them word I had not gone\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0(We know it to be true):\u8232 If she should push the matter on,\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0What would become of you?\u8232 \u8232 I gave her one, they gave him two,\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0You gave us three or more;\u8232 They all returned from him to you,\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0Though they were mine before.\u8232 \u8232 If I or she should chance to be\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0Involved in this affair,\u8232 He trusts to you to set them free,\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0Exactly as we were.\u8232 \u8232 My notion was that you had been\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0(Before she had this fit)\u8232 An obstacle that came between\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0Him, and ourselves, and it.\u8232 \u8232 Don\'92t let him know she liked them best,\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0For this must ever be\u8232 A secret, kept from all the rest,\u8232 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0Between yourself and me.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 \'93That\'92s the most important piece of evidence we\'92ve heard yet,\'94 said the King, rubbing his hands; \'93so now let the jury\'97\'94\
\'93If any one of them can explain it,\'94 said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn\'92t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) \'93I\'92ll give him sixpence.\'a0
\f1\i I
\f0\i0 \'a0don\'92t believe there\'92s an atom of meaning in it.\'94\
The jury all wrote down on their slates, \'93
\f1\i She
\f0\i0 \'a0doesn\'92t believe there\'92s an atom of meaning in it,\'94 but none of them attempted to explain the paper.\
\'93If there\'92s no meaning in it,\'94 said the King, \'93that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn\'92t try to find any. And yet I don\'92t know,\'94 he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; \'93I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. \'93\'97
\f1\i said I could not swim
\f0\i0 \'97\'94 you can\'92t swim, can you?\'94 he added, turning to the Knave.\
The Knave shook his head sadly. \'93Do I look like it?\'94 he said. (Which he certainly did\'a0
\f1\i not
\f0\i0 , being made entirely of cardboard.)\
\'93All right, so far,\'94 said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: \'93\'91
\f1\i We know it to be true
\f0\i0 \'97\'92 that\'92s the jury, of course\'97\'91
\f1\i I gave her one, they gave him two
\f0\i0 \'97\'92 why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know\'97\'94\
\'93But, it goes on \'91
\f1\i they all returned from him to you
\f0\i0 ,\'92\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Why, there they are!\'94 said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. \'93Nothing can be clearer than\'a0
\f1\i that
\f0\i0 . Then again\'97\'91
\f1\i before she had this fit
\f0\i0 \'97\'92 you never had fits, my dear, I think?\'94 he said to the Queen.\
\'93Never!\'94 said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)\
\'93Then the words don\'92t\'a0
\f1\i fit
\f0\i0 \'a0you,\'94 said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.\
\'93It\'92s a pun!\'94 the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, \'93Let the jury consider their verdict,\'94 the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.\
\'93No, no!\'94 said the Queen. \'93Sentence first\'97verdict afterwards.\'94\
\'93Stuff and nonsense!\'94 said Alice loudly. \'93The idea of having the sentence first!\'94\
\'93Hold your tongue!\'94 said the Queen, turning purple.\
\'93I won\'92t!\'94 said Alice.\
\'93Off with her head!\'94 the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.\
\'93Who cares for you?\'94 said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) \'93You\'92re nothing but a pack of cards!\'94\
At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\
\'93Wake up, Alice dear!\'94 said her sister; \'93Why, what a long sleep you\'92ve had!\'94\
\'93Oh, I\'92ve had such a curious dream!\'94 said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \'93It\'a0
\f1\i was
\f0\i0 \'a0a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\'92s getting late.\'94 So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.\
\pard\pardeftab720\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\fi240\sa60\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:\'97\
First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers\'97she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that\'a0
\f1\i would
\f0\i0 \'a0always get into her eyes\'97and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister\'92s dream.\
The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by\'97the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool\'97she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution\'97once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess\'92s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it\'97once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard\'92s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.\
So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality\'97the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds\'97the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen\'92s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy\'97and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard\'97while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle\'92s heavy sobs.\
Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make\'a0
\f1\i their
\f0\i0 \'a0eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.\
